# Reinforcement-Learning

* policy-gradient-methods-survey: A short 8 page survey of policy gradient methods including some recent 2019/2020 convergence results

TODO:
* Include more mathematical derivations/results
* Gather more results on global covergence (e.g. policy cover?)
* Missing (1 - \gamma) in global convergence results

## Algorithms

See the algorithms directory.

Depth of understanding comes from both theory and implementation, so I am implementing many of the basic (classical) RL algorithms. I will implement more recent algorithms once the classical algorithms are implemented and presented in an friendly manner. Everything here is still a work-in-progress.
